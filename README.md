# Investigate-a-Dataset

This project aims to analyze, visualize and yield findings about a dataset using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. 

You should start by taking a brief look at the data and coming up with questions to answer using NumPy. Then, choose the dataset you wish to analyze. Afterwards, aim to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in your investigation. Lastly, record and share your findings.
